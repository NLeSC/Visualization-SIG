# Visualization SIG

28-11-2019, 13:00 @VK3 SURFsara

**Attending**: _Faruk, Peter Kok, Willem, Cunliang, Pablo R., Maarten, Jaro_


## Introduction

All subscribe to the office group “Visualization Special Interest Group” which has email [visualization@esciencecenter.nl](mailto:visualization@esciencecenter.nl)

Also check our github page: [https://github.com/NLeSC/Visualization-SIG](https://github.com/NLeSC/Visualization-SIG)

Sharing the proposal for this SIG: [https://github.com/nlesc-sigs/propose-a-sig/blob/master/proposals/visualization.md](https://github.com/nlesc-sigs/propose-a-sig/blob/master/proposals/visualization.md)

We want to use this first meeting to get your input on how fill our meetings, so we have some questions for you.


## Which visualization aspects / technological fields interest you?

**Maarten**: both information and scientific visualization, with focus on SV. Computer graphics is personal interest, visual storytelling is needed in short term

**Pablo**: scientific and information visualization. Interactivity is an interest, and personal interest in graphic design.

**Willem**: know much about information visualization, and experience with graphic design. I want more practical skills

**Cunliang**: In career some experience with visualization of data

**Peter**: PhD in medical visualization of spatial images (MRI).  Infoviz, D3 etc. Want focus on user interface, interactivity, story telling. 

**Faruk**: Visualization in qbasic at primary school, after more webdev and visualization, developing a platform similar to spot. Developing interest in AR, bit of blender. Develop something together in the SIG, hands on.

**Jaro**: I’m very interested in how people perceive visual information (as well as the use of other senses) and how we can use visualization to convey scientific results and how this is influenced by the (data representation) choices we make. 


## Which scientific domains do you want to apply this?

**Willem**: Social sciences and humanities

**Cunliang**: life science and internal workings of AI

**Peter**: humanities (current project), geography, climate, astronomy

**Faruk**: information visualization in any field

**Jaro**: past astronomy, current climate and geo, future life science, any domain is interesting

**Maarten**: Climate, geovis, humanities and social sciences(short term) 

**Pablo**: large interest in interactivity in general, not a particular domain


## What format would you like the meetings to have?

_Context, we’ll have a three-weekly meeting and we can all prepare the meetings by reading, or watching cause we prefer not to do this in the meetings. How much time do you want to spend to prepare the meetings and what do you want us to do in the meeting itself?_

**All**: couple of hours (2 or 3) of preparation

**Willem**: do we talk here, do we code here?

**Faruk**: I would like hands on, maybe figure out tools and discuss 

**Willem**: Make a list of homework at the end of each meeting

**All**: We want to gather best practices, examples, tutorials, tools in a central place


## Any conferences or events you want to join?

*   Blender workshop at SURF 3rdf of december
*   SIGGRAPH (**Faruk: **personal goal, submit something to SIGGRAPH, some of the others want to join the effort)
*   Faruk: germany conference, will find out details later
*   Maarten: in the proposal in our SIG github, you can find a list of conferences I could think of, have a look there if you can find something interesting


## Homework

Before next meeting gather visualization stuff (papers, videos, tools, libraries, conferences) so we can make an [awesomelist](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list) in our github page.

**Dependencies**

1. **Willem**: make repo
2. **Jaro/Maarten**: initiate awesome list and notify the rest
