**Attending**: _Cunliang, Peter Kalverla, Peter Kok, Dafne, Stefan, Faruk, Sarah, Casper, Ben, Sonja, Maarten, Jaro_

### Meeting contents
*   We want to compare different Corona spread visualizations discussing: 
    *   What story the visualization tries to tell
    *   What encodings are used and whether this is a good idea
    *   What analysis is done on the data and how sound this is
*   See appendix for the list of visualizations and points discussed during the meeting
*   Decide on next meeting/homework

### Next meeting

*   Jaro and Maarten will think of new hacky workshoppy topic and let you know the homework soon.

### Appendix: Corona visualizations

Peter Kalverla
*   [vliegschaamte](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/21/business/coronavirus-airline-travel.html)
    *   Show the consequences instead of the actual disease. Not very information dense or easy to deduce fractions/numbers. 
    *   More about visual story telling. 
*   [the figure, not the video](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know-164413035.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLm5sLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADWZtJLWLzOK0lay4RMugl6AcFrD4m5KRWHn8sPxSbIhjkWUJ5t2yUmst7MpoUpiXPeG1XUC21imrCRNhREWvw92E6hQuBYmcixSUdAUdoQKE27nwG1Cx18Ha2ShbmvFMNItlwA5yB-sjHl_UbNizozOf3YSN7Igj64SfsZAshkL)
    *   Shows compact information about dangerousness of the disease
*   [random youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEYpOBAXuqE)
    *   Simple plot showing comparison of of different diseases over time

Cunliang Geng
*   [Genomic epidemiology of 2019-nCOV](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)
    *   Interesting graph based visualization of virus mutations. 
    *   Very busy, and not the best layout. Useful for advanced users to find information. 
*   [Map of Global Cases 1](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)
    *   Popular visualization, all over the internet
*   [Mpa of Chinese cases ](https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/view/pneumonia?scene=2&clicktime=1579582238&enterid=1579582238&from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0)
*   [Map of Global Cases 2](https://www.mapbox.cn/coronavirusmap/#1.35/0/109.8)
    *   Combination of heatmap with chloropleth is really nice. Also mentioned on [corresponding blog ](https://www.mapbox.cn/coronavirusmap/)
    *   Stacked barchart is nice but a little misleading. Could  be better by putting the cured cases underneath the zero-line.

Sarah Alidoost
*   https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
    *   Information that local people have access to. However the info is misleading due to oversimplification. 

Sonja Georgievska

    *   Again the chloropleth problem

Peter Kok

    *   Too unclear, fancy 3D but hard to navigate. Too much information, 

Paul Melis
*   https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html
    *   Showing very detailed information per patient, which would not be possible for European people but is very informative. 

Jaro/Jerom
*   https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/02/24/coronavirus-is-goed-voor-milieu-en-klimaat/
    *   Showing positive effect of corona outbreak
