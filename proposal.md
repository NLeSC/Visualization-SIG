# Application form for starting a SIG


## What will be the name of the SIG
Visualization SIG


## Which two persons will act as SIG Lead?
- Maarten van Meersbergen
- Paul Melis (SURF/Sara)
- Jaro Camphuijsen


## What is the SIG’s mission?
The mission of the Visualization SIG is summarized as follows:
- To enhance the escience center's understanding in the broadest sense of the word in the fields of 
    - Scientific Visualization
    - Information Visualization
- With ancillary knowledge gathering in the fields of
    - Computer Graphics
    - Virtual and Augmented Reality
    - Citizen Science 
    - Serious Games
    - Visual Storytelling
- To discuss challenges posed related to these fields and 
- (potentially) come up with novel solutions to these challenges
- Apply acquired knowledge to NLeSC projects
- Outreach and education of best practices and skills for employees, project partners and other interested parties


## What GitHub repository will the SIG use?
https://github.com/nlesc-sigs/visualization


## What Office group will the SIG use?
visualization@esciencecenter.nl


## Plans for period until end of April 2020
**Project implementation**
We aim to apply the acquired knowledge and skills in running and new projects of the members of this SIG and report on that through blogs or visualization (see output). A few examples of running projects where visualizations play a role are:

- The RECEIPT project: Will run for 4 years, and will provide ample opportunities for the application of knowledge in the fields this SIG supports. Of special note are Data Journalism skills and techniques.

- eWaterCycle II: Makes extensive use of visualizations in the different phases of its runtime. Examples include the [explorer](https://explore.ewatercycle.org/), the [forecast](https://forecast.ewatercycle.org/) and analysis and visualization of results(future work). 

- TICCLAT: The PI is interested in showing the results and workings of the OCR post-correction developed in the project, as well as additional uses for the database created.

- Algorithmic Geo Visualization (Thijs van Lankveld)


**State of the Art**
We aim to enable members of this SIG to attend relevant events, to gather state-of-the-art knowledge and share it with the group. For these events, it should be discussed if 'someone' in the SIG should go and report back in the form of an in-SIG presentation. A (short) written report should also be made available on the SIG GitHub page or as a blog. 
Below is a collection of events we deem relevant. The amount of + behind each entry gives some insight in their relative importance, the amount of $ is an indication of the cost to attend, including travel costs.

- October 11th 2019: Infographics conference in Hilversum, relevant talks on data visualization and data journalism. https://www.infographicscongres.eu/ ++ $

- November 8th 2019: SURF organizes the VARR out event, which will be attended by members. The knowledge gained from this event will be presented in the SIG for those that could not attend.

- November 19–22 2019, Open Visualization Conference https://odsc.com/london/open-visualization-conference/, London + $$$

- May 14-16 2020, OpenVIS conference http://www.openvisconf.com/, a two-day, single track conference centered around the practice of visualizing data with open source tools on the web, Paris ++, $$

- May 25-29 2020, EuroVis, a visualisation conference organised every year by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualisation, Norrköping, Sweden ++++ $$$

- July 19-23 2020: SIGGRAPH 2020 international conference & exhibition on computer graphics & interactive techniques in Washington DC. ++++ $$$$

- October 2020 IEEE Vis conference on cutting edge research and innovations in data visualisation in Salt Lake City, USA ++++ $$$$


## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
- Presentations/blogs on the attendance of related conferences.
- Presentations/blogs or (guide additions) on lessons learned/best practices in data visualization.
- Organize open workshops (together with SURF) on several topics in visualization.
 

## What are the expected resources needed for this SIG?
- Travel budget to visit conferences for SIG members
- Time/Budget/PR to prepare and give workshops
- Time for SIG members to attend meetings, achieve goals and create outputs for members
- Time for SIG leads to organize meetings, manage the SIG's process and write half yearly report/proposal
