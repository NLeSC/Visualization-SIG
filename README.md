# NLeSC & SURFsara - Visualization and Computer Graphics Special Interest Group

## Advice on Visualization?

If you want to get some advice on how to handle a specific Visualization task, or some feedback on visualization work you've done, this SIG is the place. Please make an issue on this repo to schedule a date.

### What do you need?

 - Open an issue on GitHub and label it `Help | Title`.
 - Describe the type of issue you want to address. Make sure to include:
    - What is your final goal?
    - What is the challenge?
    - A sample of your code (if possible).

We will discuss your issue during the next SIG meeting.

## Share your visualization solutions

Did you do something really cool? Share your experiences with the SIG! Please contact either of the the SIG chairs (Maarten van Meersbergen or Paul Melis) to schedule a short presentation.
