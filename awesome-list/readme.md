## Tools

### Tabular data
Vaex, visualize tabular data with billions of rows made possible by using lazy evaluations. Kinda like Datashader but then way faster. More info here https://towardsdatascience.com/vaex-a-dataframe-with-super-strings-789b92e8d861

### Visual programming
Rete.js, a node based interface for visual programming in javascript. A nifty framework to make your own custom node based interfaces, been using it now for a project and it gave a good base to build our own node based visualization interface.
